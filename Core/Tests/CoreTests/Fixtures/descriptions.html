For nearly two years now, I've been using this channel to explore questions relating to wars, defence strategy and economics. I've been able to do so because of the unwavering support from all of you.<br><br>So today, as a way to welcome 2024, I'm answer your questions for a change:<br>What are the modern roles for tactical nuclear weapons? <br>How have Special Operations Forces been used in Ukraine?<br>Would I rather fight a cruiser sized duck or a thousand duck sized cruisers?<br>What can I tell you about the Perun audience?<br> And how did this "Perun" bloke end up talking about Defence Economics anyway?<br><br>Hope you enjoy this special episode, and we'll be back to regular content next week.<br><br>Gaming channel cross promotion:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPYJiiMoA0yOMHI-aiB44RQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPYJiiMoA0yOMHI-aiB44RQ</a><br><br>Patreon:<br><a href="https://www.patreon.com/PerunAU">https://www.patreon.com/PerunAU</a><br><br>Relevant Reading (somewhat abbreviated as it's a more casual episode)<br><br>Relevant RUSI reports as previously cited, beginning with: <br><a href="https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/special-resources/preliminary-lessons-conventional-warfighting-russias-invasion-ukraine-february-july-2022">https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/special-resources/preliminary-lessons-conventional-warfighting-russias-invasion-ukraine-february-july-2022</a><br><br>Mentioned report on Soviet Nuclear planning 1970s<br><a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2012-090-doc1.pdf">https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2012-090-doc1.pdf</a><br><br>CBO report on nukes -
